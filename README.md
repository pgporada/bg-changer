A shell script to set NASA Picture of the Day as Wallpaper of Ubuntu with Gnome Shell or Unity Desktop Environment.

# USAGE 



# Why this script again

There is plenty of incompleted scripts on the net that do the same thing but  they are incomplete, deprecated, not well done, poorly documented or simply not available in shell scripting.

This repository will maintain the shell script for Bash.
