A shell script to set NASA Picture of the Day as Wallpaper for Ubuntu.

# USAGE 

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:aljimohamed/ppa
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt install bg-changer

# Why this script

There is plenty of incompleted scripts on the net that do the same thing but they are either deprecated or poorly documented or simply not available in shell scripting.

This repository will maintain *bg-changer* shell script for Bash under Ubuntu.
