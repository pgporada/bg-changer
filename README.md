# Project Overview : BG-Changer

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSryx/bg-changer/master/rocket.png)
A shell script to set NASA Picture of the Day as Wallpaper for Ubuntu.

# USAGE 

First, you need to download the script, I suggest you position in an appropriate directory, then do this :

`git clone https://github.com/OSryx/bg-changer.git bg-changer`

To install the script, you need to type :

`cd bg-changer` and then `sudo make install`

Or you can set the script to execute daily (at 6 p.m) by typing : `sudo make daily`

To execute the script, please type :

`$ bash bg-changer` or simply `$ bg-changer`.

In case you don't like the script you can remove it, using the following command: 

`sudo make remove`

# Why this script

There is plenty of incompleted scripts on the net that do the same thing but they are either deprecated or poorly documented or simply not available in shell scripting.

This repository will maintain *bg-changer* shell script for Bash under Ubuntu.
